## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pabloarzaoo/Weather-Thing
cd weather-cli
```

2. Install the dependencies:

## 🔑 API Configuration

This project uses the **free OpenWeatherMap API**.

1. Create an account at:
   [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Generate your **API Key**
3. Replace the key in the code:

```python
api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
```

⚠️ **Important:** It is not recommended to commit your API key to public repositories.

---

## ▶️ How to Use

Run the script:

```bash
python weather.py
```

The program will:

1. Validate the API key
2. Automatically detect your location
3. Fetch current weather data
4. Display a detailed 5-day forecast
5. Show air quality information (when available)

---

## 🧠 Notes

* If automatic detection fails, the program will ask for manual input
* The free API may have availability limitations for air quality data in some regions
* All times are adjusted to the **detected local timezone**
